      <p>COVID-19, short for "Coronavirus Disease 2019," is a highly contagious viral illness caused by a novel
        coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The disease was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei
        province, China, and it has since evolved into a global pandemic, affecting nearly every corner of the world.

        <p>Vaccination: Get vaccinated if you are eligible and have not yet received the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination
          significantly reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death.

          Wear Face Masks: Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth in indoor public spaces, especially if social
          distancing is challenging. Masks are effective in reducing the spread of respiratory droplets that may contain
          the
          virus.
